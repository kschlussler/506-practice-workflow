# 506-practice-workflow
This repository is a primer for 504/507 Fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow.

## Project Summary
This project includes variables of various types (number, string, list, and dictionary) and a function to compare two numbers. The function demonstrates basic Python control flow using an if/else statement.

### Variables
- **number_var**: An integer with a value of `42`.
- **string_var**: A string with a value of `"Hello, GitHub!"`.
- **list_var**: A list containing the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- **dict_var**: A dictionary with a name, age, attributes (including a list and nested dictionary), and a boolean flag.

### Function
The `analyze_number` function compares two numbers and returns a string indicating which is greater. 

**Example Output:**
- Comparison Result: `10 is not greater than 20`
